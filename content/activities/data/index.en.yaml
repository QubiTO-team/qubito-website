    **QubiTO Quantum Days** is a three-day event at **Politecnico di Torino**
    to celebrate 100 years of quantum mechanics.
    It tells the story of how quantum ideas grew into today’s new technologies.

    Talks by **Prof. Adami** and **Scott Aaronson** will explore past and future discoveries,
    and a workshop will show real experiments on quantum computers.

    📅 November 12–14, 2025 📍 Politecnico di Torino

  description: "Our team obtained a great result at the GenQ Hackathon, hosted by QAI Ventures at CERN, where we competed in a series of exciting quantum machine learning challenges. We split into two groups to tackle distinct problems: medical image classification and air quality forecasting. Our efforts were rewarded when the medical imaging team secured 2nd Place and brought home the Innovation Award."
