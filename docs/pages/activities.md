# How to Add a New Activity

To contribute a new activity to the QubiTO Team website, follow these steps using the `content/activities/data/index.en.yaml` file as a reference.

## Steps

1. **Open the file:**  
   Edit `content/activities/data/index.en.yaml`.

2. **Add a new activity entry:**  
   Each activity is a YAML object (starting with `-`) with several properties.  
   Copy and modify an existing entry or create a new one at the top or bottom of the list.

3. **Fill in the properties:**  
   The main properties for each activity are:

   - `icon`: Emoji or icon representing the activity.
   - `header`: Title of the activity.
   - `badge`: Year or label for the activity.
   - `description`: Brief description of the activity.
   - `isMainActivity`: `true` if it's a main activity, `false` otherwise.
   - `images`: (optional) List of image paths related to the activity.
   - `link`: (optional)  
     - `url`: External link for more info.  
     - `text`: Text for the link button.

4. **Save and create a pull request:**  
   See the [Contribution Guide](../README.md) for details.

```yaml
- icon: "üßë‚Äçüî¨"

## Configuration
