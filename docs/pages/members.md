A page/ or section with the members list, then each member has their own page 
/members and /members/walid-bou-ezz the member page also has the list of articles written by the member.

For the authors page, we do not add the members as authors however the website checks if the author of the article is also a member and fetches more data about them, and instead of linking to /authors/walid-bou-ezz (a page which only shows the author's information), it links to /members/walid-bou-ezz (a page which shows the member's information).

This way we can still have external articles/ colaborators without hardcoding members as authors
