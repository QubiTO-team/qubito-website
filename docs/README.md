### QubiTO Team Members

If you are a member of the QubiTO Team:
- Please contact us to be added as a contributor.
- Once added, you can contribute by following these steps:

  1. **Create a new branch from `main`**  
     In your local repository, run:
     ```sh
     git checkout main
     git pull
     git checkout -b feature-branch-name
     ```
     Or create a branch from `main` using GitHub's web interface.

  2. **Make your changes on your branch**  
     Edit files, add content, or update documentation as needed.  
     Stage and commit your changes:
     ```sh
     git add .
     git commit -m "Describe your changes"
     ```

  3. **Push your branch to GitHub**  
     ```sh
     git push origin feature-branch-name
     ```

  4. **Create a Pull Request (PR) into `staging`**  
     On GitHub, open a Pull Request from your branch (`feature-branch-name`) into the `staging` branch (not directly into `main`).  
     This allows your changes to be reviewed before merging.

If you need help with these steps, please contact the team for guidance.

### External Contributors

If you are not part of the QubiTO Team but wish to contribute:
- Fork the repository on GitHub.
